The mechanical half of the create-readme skill's rules, checked on any markdown

  check-prose.sh DOC...

  -h, --help   print this and exit

The rules are the readme's, and they hold over every document a repository ships — a
SKILL.md and a changelog are read on the same page by the same reader. Only what a
script can decide is here: whether a paragraph ends bare, whether it occupies one line,
whether an admonition is shaped the way GitHub wants it, whether a quotation mark is the
typographic one, and whether a section duplicates a file that already exists. Tone,
structure and honesty about versions stay a reading job. A finding is one line on
stderr, DOC:LINE: what, so an editor can jump to it

A YAML frontmatter block is data rather than prose, and is skipped: its keys are not
paragraphs, and two of them in a row are not a hard wrap

Before it reads the documents it was given, it proves each rule on two documents of its
own: one written to break every rule, where each finding is demanded by name, and one
written to break none, which must be silent. A check that has never been red is a
decoration, and this file travels to repositories that keep no fixture for it
Environment: CHECK_PROSE_NESTED=1 skips that proof, and is how the proof runs this copy

Nothing here reaches the network
Exit 0 when every document keeps the rules, 1 with one line per finding, 2 on a usage
error or a document that does not exist

This paragraph ends with a full stop.

**A bold paragraph that still ends with one.**

A remark, then a parenthesis that ends with one. (Like this.)

Some `code at the end that ends with one.`

This paragraph is hard-wrapped across
two lines, which a one-word edit would reflow

> [!NOTE] the keyword does not have its line to itself

A paragraph carrying « on its own, since a pair on one line lets a live half cover a dead one

A paragraph carrying » on its own

A paragraph carrying “ on its own

A paragraph carrying ” on its own

A paragraph carrying ‘ on its own

A paragraph carrying ’ on its own

name: a-document
description: "A frontmatter is data. Its keys are not paragraphs, two in a row are not a hard wrap, and a sentence in a field ends the way a sentence does."
---

# A document breaking none of them, titled like the contributing skill

1. A numbered list item, which is a list item and not a paragraph
2. A second one right after it, which is not a hard wrap

## Before contributing to someone else's project

A heading that is the word is a second copy of a file that already exists; one that contains it is a section about the topic

## What goes to git and the changelog

A rule has to be able to show the character it forbids, so a code span holding `«one»`, `“another”` or `‘a third’` is naming a character rather than quoting with it

> [!NOTE]
> An admonition with the keyword alone on its line, the way GitHub wants it

```sh
# Inside a fence, a sentence may end with a full stop.
echo "and a hard wrap
across two lines is code, not prose."

    An indented block is code too.
    Two lines of it.
