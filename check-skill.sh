The gate a skill repository needs, in one file that travels. It proves that SKILL.md is
loadable at all, that every file under references/ is reachable from SKILL.md by
following links, and that every relative link and heading anchor in the docs resolves —
then proves each of those checks able to fail, on throwaway copies of the repository
with one planted defect each, every time it runs. A check that has never been red is a
decoration, and a copy of this file is falsified in its own repository on every run. It
has no repo-specific part: another repository takes it through the vendoring cascade
(references/bump-cascade.md in https://github.com/rokokol/ci-skill) and calls it from
its own gate

  check-skill.sh [--strict] [-n NAME] [DIR]

DIR is the skill's repository (default: the current directory). -n NAME is what the
readme and the install symlink call the skill, which the frontmatter must agree with.
Nothing here reaches the network.
Exit 1 with `check-skill: <what>` on the first finding, 2 on a usage error

Two tiers. An error is what stops a skill loading or leaves a reference unread, and it
is the first finding: exit 1, the message on stderr. A warning is a rule of the family
the skill breaks without breaking: `check-skill: warning: FILE:LINE: ID: what` on
stdout, the exit code unchanged, and under GITHUB_ACTIONS a ::warning annotation as
well. --strict turns every warning into a finding: the lines go to stderr too and the
run exits 1 after the scan

A line that is right for a reason is excused in check-skill.allow beside SKILL.md, a
file no agent loads: one entry per line, `ID PATH [TEXT]`, excusing warnings of ID in
PATH, or only those on lines that contain TEXT when it is given; `#` opens a comment.
An entry that excuses nothing is an error, like a malformed one: left in place, it
would silently excuse the next real violation that lands on that path

CHECK_SKILL_NESTED=1 skips the self-falsification and runs only the checks. The planted
copies are run that way, and so should a gate that runs this script inside copies of its
own repository

The warnings, by the id each line carries:
  layout-section     a Layout heading in SKILL.md or a reference: readme content,
                     loaded on every request
  install-section    an Install, Installation, Setup or Checkout heading in SKILL.md
  history-wording    used to, previously, formerly: a rule is written as acting
  pseudo-citation    a path/to/file.ext:NN citation into a checkout the reader may lack
  discovery-date     a date beside found, fixed, decided…: when a defect was found
                     bounds nothing
  cross-skill-link   a runtime link to another skill's repository, or outside this one
  harness-file       CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md or .cursorrules named alone, without
                     AGENTS.md beside it
  prompt-idiom       MUST or CRITICAL in capitals, IMPORTANT:, take a deep breath,
                     comprehensive, Red Flags
  model-id           a concrete model id where an example should say <model>
  recheck-instruction  double-check, verify your work, a reviewing agent as a step: a
                     review happens when the user asks, not on the skill's say-so
  unverified-source  a fetch-failure note beside a claim
  trigger-duplicate  a trigger listed twice in the description
  readme-badge       the readme's badge row does not open with the Agent Skill badge
  harness-badge      the readme carries a harness badge, claiming a dependency
